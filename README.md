# Community To Me

## Project Overview

This site is a visualization of an excerpt from the poem "Someday I'll Love Ocean Vuong" by Ocean Vuong. I chose a work from Ocean Vuong becuase he is a modern poet that is part of the queer vietnamese diasphoric community that I also consider myself a part of, thus these words resonate with my concept of community. For me, community is something you build. Even though most of us are born into a certain community, whether it be through family, race, or religion, we can lose these communities if we present outside of its cultural norms. So, for many people, they must build a community of their own.

In this poem, Vuong speaks on the journey of loneliness until you reach a place in your life where you've realized that all the friendships and love you've created stays with you and becomes a part of you, a community of you.

## Technical Overview

This was coded on Visual Studio Code using HTML and CSS. The site is being hosted on GitHub. Without using any images, I visualized the poem using animation and color on the text to create enphasis and signal which words link to the next page. I used mostly translation transitions to allude to continuation of the poem. I also used delayed opacity to create a fade-in effect for the transition between pages to be more seamless.
